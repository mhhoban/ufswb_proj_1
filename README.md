#Movie Trailer Website Powered by Fresh Tomatoes

Running the project will generate a website listing a few of my
favorite movies, along with their movie posters that double as links
to youtube trailers for the movies.

#Requirements:

This project requires you to have installed the Python 2.7 Interpreter on your
system.

#Setup:

This project repository comes with all the files necessary to generate
the movie trailer web page. Run `python entertainment_center.py` from the
project directory. This will generate the .html file for the page in the
project directory and launch the page in your default browser.
